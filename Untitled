// use type alias, type alias is not a value,its a type definition

type UserRole = "admin" | "user" | "guest"; // benefit of using type alias is that we can reuse the type later on in the code
let userRole5: UserRole = "admin"; // this way we can update the type later on in the code without having to change the code everywhere
